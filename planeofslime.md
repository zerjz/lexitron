<!-- TITLE: The Plane of Slime -->

The epicenter of everything slimy, gooey, and sticky, The Plane of Slime is a bizarre dungeonlike realm full of living slimes, slime elementals, slime goblins, and other such creations. A clever band of goblins were drawn to this realm because the sentient slime creatures were found to be easily manipulated and controlled, and the goblins enjoyed finally having a sense of power over something, so they moved in and took over as the self proclaimed rulers of the plane. Recently, a shard of a neighboring plane, Glimmer, the Plane of Luster, fell into the Plane of Slime, piercing through its dimensional fabric.
