# Enter Magnos
Located directly in the center of all universes, Magnos is a dimensional crossroads, a "cosmic sanctuary" full of life from every corner of every universe. The energies of Magnos are welcoming, and its dimensional walls are very thin, allowing a vast amount of alternate planes and dimensions to leak into it.

Being a diverse melting pot has allowed Magnos to become a prevalent and powerful realm, and many of existence's top names have spent a great amount of time there. 

Unlike some dimensions, Magnos is not ruled over by any patron gods or deities, owing its own existence only to itself. This fact does not stop the dimension's multi-culturaled residents from openly practicing their belief systems, and many of the races living in Magnos have their own complex deity structures.

Mana is a precious resource in Magnos. Once plentiful and abundant, over time, the effects of all those who seek to harness the power of mana have taken their toll. Though there is a great deal of stockpiled mana in the world, new mana is now only generated into Magnos by the mining and refining of Manastone. There are several prominent mines, Malefix being the most noteable, though it is currently unknown exactly how much Manastone is left in the world or if it is scarce.

Change is rapid in Magnos, and as the dimension grows in population, it expands itself to accomodate. New unexplored areas of the dimension are always being discovered, making it an ideal place for adventurous souls to reside
