<!-- TITLE: The Citadel of Ivy -->

Home to the Cult of Ivy, this citadel located deep in The Humid Plains is a dangerous expedition for those brave enough to face the Ivy cultists. A few years ago, a mentally unstable Hedgecrafter named Ivy decided that she was going to become the ultimate nature witch, and turn her own body into that of a plant. She viewed plants as being far superior to humankind, and worshipped them so much that she felt inferior as a High Elf. She eventually succeeded in her plans, and her blood turned to chlorophyll. Her skin became ivy. What's more, she was able to manipulate her own cells so that she could assume her old form, and walk amongst society without causing alarm. She preached her ways to eager young Hedgecrafters and gained a following, which eventually grew into a full fledged cult. They cultivated beautiful but deadly plants, and over time, their plants became sentient, just like their creators. But the plants weren't satisfied with being worshipped and doted on. They too wanted to walk amongst society on two legs. They too wanted to have all the rights and privileges of their masters. The plants struggled, and strained, and manipulated their own cellular structure to become like their masters. The plants began to bleed. Their chlorophyll began flowing red. Their leaves turned to hands, their roots to feet. While Ivy wanted so desperately to become like the plants she loved most, her own creations wanted to be more like her.
