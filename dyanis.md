<!-- TITLE: Dyanis -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The Fields of Gold -->

Long ago, an angel from the heavens above descended upon the land now known as Dyanis. There is little that known about her, not even her name, if she has one. The people of Dyanis refer to her as 'The One Angel', or just 'The One', and after The One landed, she created the blessed race of Golden Angels, her children. 

In the beginning, the Angels were immortal, intended to be the protectors of Dyanis - or so they assume. Nothing is certain to the Angels until their creator returns to tell them what her intentions were when creating them. Over time, the Angels bloodline has thinned, and they have lost their immortality, though they do still live very long lives.

It has been so long since The One visited Dyanis, the Angels now forget even what she looked like. All that anyone knows about her has been passed down through word of mouth over the years. The Angels of Dyanis recently built a monument to her, hoping that she will take notice and return to her people.(edited)
Though the Angels blood simply isn't what it used to be, it still holds great powers. All of the Angels are linked together through their blood. When one Angel makes a decision or an action, it affects all of them. Therefore, their people operate as one collective unit. Whatever one Angel speaks into being will be felt by all others. If an Angel wanted someone dead, for example, so it would be. The person would be dead, and the Angel would be a murderer. Not only himself, but all of the Angels. The weight of murder would be heavy on everyone's conscience, not just the one who wished it into being.
As a collective, the Angels are very careful with their decisions. They all understand the weight behind their actions, so they act very carefully and with much deliberation among their people. This system of group decision making worked very well for quite some time, until one fateful day that changed everything.(edited)
One day, a very young and somewhat rebellious Angel was out in the fields when a stranger approached him.

"I can offer you great wealth and fame, in exchange for just a small piece of your land," he said. 

The young Angel knew that this would be a terrible decision, and one that would get him into much trouble with the rest of our people. He declined the man's offer.

"If you change your mind," said the stranger, "I will be out here in this very spot, waiting for you."
The young Angel went back to the village and asked his parents why the man would want to own a piece of Dyanis. As far as he knew, it was nothing but rolling hills and babbling brooks. When he told them what had happened, his parents were aghast. For they knew exactly what the man wanted. 

For the Golden Angels, actions are entirely permanent. Going back to a previous example: if an Angel were to wish death upon someone, they would die. Once that happened, if another Angel were to wish them back alive, it would not be so, for the deed would have already been done by another Angel, and there is no reversing their decisions.
The child's parents knew that if the man were to be granted ownership of their land, there would be no taking it back, no matter how terribly he abused the land. They strictly forbade their son from ever speaking to the man again, and went off into the fields to search for the man. They did not find him. 

That night, the boy tossed and turned in his bed. Oh, how he imagined the great wealth that was promised to him. He fantasized about leaving the simple life of the Angels and being someone of great importance in the outside world. 

"I don't want this life," he thought to himself, "and I'm not going to let anyone stop me from achieving greatness." He slept, dreaming of the wonderful life he would soon have.

The next morning, the boy eagerly arose from bed and got dressed. He ran into the fields as fast as he could to find the man who had approached him. The stranger was waiting for him, just like he said he would be.

"I want wealth! I want power!" the boy said. "I don't care about this stupid backwards tribe, take all our land, it's yours!" The man smiled and handed the boy a small red card.

 "Take this into Xuolia and show it to the bouncer outside Club Crimson. He will let you through the gates. There, an associate of mine will be waiting for you to help get acquainted to the lifestyle of great fame and fortune."

He also handed the boy a huge sack of platinum, heavy as could be, and from the trees came a pack mule, draped in finely dyed blankets and with saddle bags full of precious gemstones.
In his foolishness, the boy spoke his words into being. He didn't just give the man ownership of a small piece of land like he originally asked for, he gave him the entire fields, just like that.

Immediately, all of the Angels reeled from the decision they felt being made. The boy's parents cried out, and ran into the fields to find him. No one ever found the boy, nor the stranger, ever again. No one knows what sort of life that boy is now living, or where he might be. 

As for the consequences of his actions - they were terrible. Almost at once, great swarms of goblins invaded the lands, armed with picks and explosives and all sorts of ruinous implements. They mined all the gold they could find, and they continue digging, searching for something that has yet to be found. The creatures of the land grew angry, and then mean. The Angels were pushed out of the fields entirely, and now spend all their time in a simple village by the sea

The Angels have consciously made the decision to stop procreating, so that no further Angels will be stuck with the fate that they all share. Someday, the Angels will be gone, and all that will be left is their story.
