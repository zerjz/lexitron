<!-- TITLE: Xuolia -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The City of Mana -->

The illustrious City of Mana, named for the decadent fact that nearly the entire city is built from bricks of Manastone. The cocky and arrogant High Elven royal family of Xuolia, currently composed of King Cashamil Xuolia and his dear wife Queen Franchesa Xuolia, rule over the city with a tight grip. 

One of the first major cities to spring up in Magnos, Xuolia is very old and full of rich history. For many generations, it was prosperous and led by a royal family that while not always beloved, ran like a well-oiled machine.

The High Elves were the first race to discover the refining of Manastone, an organic mineral previously thought to be useless, as it is fragile, unstable, and unfit to be used as a building material. Learning how to tap into the raw power of mana was a huge leap forward for all of mankind, and Xuolia became the dominant power in the world's economy.

In their arrogance, the High Elven royal family - a political system structured more like a company than an actual family - built a majestic city deep in the carved out recesses of Malefix, the sprawling Manastone mines that the Xuolian family laid claim to. Even though the Elves had knowledge that Manastone bricks were much too fragile for building structures, they built the entire city from it as a garish statement of their fortune.

For many hundreds of years, the city grew and grew in political and economic power, each new generation of royal family replicating the success of the previous one. This began to change nearly 200 years ago when then-king Argo Xuolia launched a controversial military order to invade one of the Lesser Planes, a primitive jungle planet called Ott. There they enslaved nearly an entire race of jungle Trolls and brought them back to Xuolia. They forced the Trolls to labor in the mines and repair the city's Manastone structures, which had long since started to deteriorate.
Though Xuolia had long had a reputation for making bold global decisions, many felt that the enslavement of the Ott Trolls was inhumane and chose to no longer trust or support Xuolia. King Argo's plan to generate more profits with free labor backfired, and the city's loss of social status hurt them far worse.

Breaking a long cycle of pure success, King Argo knew his misstep would leave a lasting historical impact, but fearful of making it appear to the public that the royal family could possibly be unsure of its actions, he continued on with the original plan.

Argo's jealous younger brother, Prince Cashamil, saw this weakness in Argo as something he could exploit. In secret, Cashamil led his own expedition to Ott, ordering his royal Enchanters to manipulate the minds of the remaining Trolls there. He convinced them to trust him, and outfitted them with dangerous weapons. Cashamil led his new Troll army into Malefix, and once the laboring Xuolia-owned Trolls saw their bretheren leading a resistance against the city, it didn't take much to convince them to join in. Now tripled in size, Cashamil's Troll troops stormed through the mines and into the city where mass chaos erupted.

Xuolia's military force, while very strong, had never planned on having to defend themselves in their own home. Every blast of magic from the city's Sorcerers threatened to break apart the fragile city walls, and in fear of causing a collapse in the cave's ceiling, all magic-users were ordered to cease their fire.
Without the mana-fueled crutch the city had come to rely on, Xuolian soldiers were easily outmatched by the strong and savage Ott Trolls. They breached the Xuolia Royal Palace and unceremoniously killed King Argo, his wife, and all of their royal advisors. Cashamil was the new king of Xuolia.

King Cashamil was very cunning and knew that his first official orders had to look good in the public eye. His city had faltered from his older brother's mistake, and he was intent on gaining back the people's respect. He commanded the royal Sages and Philosophers to educate and enlighten the Ott Trolls, and bestowed upon them the gift of innate magic. The now-intelligent Trolls were given large sums of platinum and gold and set free into the world. Some chose to return to their home planet of Ott to cultivate its first advanced civilization, but many stayed in Magnos, where the opportunity for a good life had already been established.
Shortly after beginning his reign, Cashamil married a beautiful young baroness named Franchesa. The new Queen was a beloved icon for her grace, sense of style, and successful political campaigns. The royal family mostly played things safe with the way they ran the city, piggybacking on the strategies and successes of their predecessors. When the well of plans ran dry and it was time for Cashamil to provide his own original political decisions, he discovered that his plan of leadership had not been well thought out. He knew how to make himself appear to be a successful king up until this point, but his term still had many years left and his inexperience had caught up with him. King Cashamil began to become very paranoid that he would be seen as a fool to the people of the world, and began spending less and less time in the public eye.

His advisors, troubled by the king's reclusive behavior, decided to take advantage of the queen's popularity and began marketing her as the city's main figurehead. By this point, mental illness had completely taken over King Cashamil, and internally it was known that he was unfit to make any further political decisions. Franchesa was being all but controlled by her advisors, and every appearance she made was planned and scripted by a team of behind-the-scenes decision makers.
Recently, Queen Franchesa was the target of a brutal terrorist attack against the city of Xuolia, and though eyewitnesses report that she was clearly wounded in the bombing, she appeared in public a few days later to give a statement that she was fine and recovered quickly. She has not made a public appearance since that day, and King Cashamil is said to have returned to his throne in the Xuolia Royal Palace, which has had its public entrances sealed up and made off-limits.

Little has been seen of the royal family, and news from within the city has died down to nothingness. 

The delicate Manastone bricks that comprise the city itself are in severe disrepair, weakening and crumbling more every day.
