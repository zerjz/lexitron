<!-- TITLE: Monk -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Monks are a sect of priest that have taken a vow to remain pure and chaste. They diligently train their bodies to ignore earthly temptations and needs. A Monk's ultimate goal is to achieve a state of enlightenment that transcends the mortal plane. Pacifist by nature, a Monk will defend himself if necessary, using hand to hand weapons, blunt objects, deadly shurikens, and sharp katanas -->
