<!-- TITLE: S'Aquia, City of the Sirens -->

Ruled by the moody and sensual Queen Ssyrella, the S'Aquia sirens have learned an important skill - seduction. They use their feminine wile to charm all those who might be inclined to succumb to their ways. Fortunately for most of Magnos, the sirens of S'Aquia have a particular fondness for Dark Elves... their innocence and naivety appeals to the manipulative and predatory nature of the sirens. S'Aquia as a city is a vital port town, with many ships coming and going from its harbor... if you can get past the sirens without falling deeply in love with them.
