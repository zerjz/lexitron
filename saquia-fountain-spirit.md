> "As the story goes, a young child tossed a coin into the fountain of S'Aquia as if to offer up a wish.  A pirate of disrepute took notice and waited for the child to leave before reclaiming the coin for himself.  Upon scooping up the disc of precious metal there was a tumultuous roar, the clap of water on stone, and then the pirate and coin, both, were gone."
