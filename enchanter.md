<!-- TITLE: Enchanter -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Enchanters are masters of the material world, augmenting and altering objects as they see fit. With a wave of the hand, they can curse and uncurse items, supercharge their allies, and severely weaken their opponents. Enchanters are also able to communicate with the supernatural realm, calling forth a friendly magical wisp to aid them on their travels. Many Enchanters choose to specialize in the art of jewelcrafting, as precious gems are particularly conducive to their enchantment magics -->
