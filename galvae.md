<!-- TITLE: Gal'Vae -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: City of the Dead -->

Once a bustling city founded by enterprising adventurers who wanted to establish an outpost deep in the wilderness, Gal'Vae earned itself the title City of the Dead through the clandestine practices of its inhabitants. Occultists and Demonologists are drawn to Gal'Vae for its relaxed laws and the city officials' tendency to turn a blind eye to any strange goings on. Xuolia, on the other hand, is famous for its stern and xenophobic attitude, strict city laws, and crumbling royal family. It is no wonder that those who are interested in the darker things in life would gravitate toward Gal'Vae, and these days, the streets are just as filled with spirits and demons as they are with the living.

In recent times, the unruly nature of Gal'Vae's political systems have at times gotten out of hand, and an increasing desire to harness more and more mana drove the city to a one-sided rivalry with Xuolia. Although Gal'Vae once contended to be a world power, they have since fallen on hard times with the sudden cutoff of traffic going into the city. Isolation and loneliness led the citizens to summon more and more otherwordly companions, further compounding the city's reputation for being a frightening place to go to.

Gal'Vae has launched misguided terrorist attacks on Xuolia, who could easily crush them if their own political system wasn't also in a state of chaos. Gal'Vaens are lucky that they struck Xuolia and began infiltrating the nearby Mines of Mana while Xuolia was having its own crisis and couldn't fight back - a healthy Xuolia would have wiped Gal'Vae off the map in an instant.
