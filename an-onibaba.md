> "I was invited to stay the night in a hut belonging to the friendly inhabitants of Telvaz, but when strange sounds awoke me in the middle of the night I rose to see what I could make of their source.  The friendly inhabitants of Telvaz were milling about the shore, transformed by the moonlight into ghastly hags.  As quickly as I rose, I had fled the village, confused and bewildered."
