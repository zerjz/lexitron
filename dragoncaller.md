<!-- TITLE: Dragoncaller -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: To be a Dragoncaller one must know what it is to be a dragon.  These warriors have studied their draconic allies with a feverish intensity and have crafted a fighting style completely unique to their caste.  To become a full fledged Dragoncaller, students of the art will have to befriend and summon their own scaled guardian to become fully initiated. -->
