<!-- TITLE: Factory -->

Deep in the heart of New Mechatropolis stands a giant factory. This factory is where all of the technology for the city is produced, including the roaming mechanical guards and servants. It's rumored that the mayor resides inside the factory as well, but no one has ever been inside to verify this claim.
