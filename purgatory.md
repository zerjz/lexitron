<!-- TITLE: The Frozen Purgatory -->

<!-- SUBTITLE: Guide written by Thrule Ursai -->

Welcome to [Magnos](magnos), refugee.  You’re probably asking yourself how you got here, or where here is.  Probably even who you are or what your role is.  I can’t really answer that for you, but I figure you’ve got a pretty good shot at finding out for yourself if you push onward.  It’s going to take grit and perseverance, but chances are you won’t be going it alone.  So let’s begin.

This frozen menagerie with a [trippy background beat](music) will be your home for a while, so settle in.  

# Introduction
You’ve selected your [class](classes), maybe even settled on a [race](races) you weren’t particularly happy with.  Luckily for you you’ll have some options to fine tune your persona.

# Haze of Introspection
You may get disoriented around this shimmering presence, but if you concentrate enough and put enough effort into your thoughts, you may be able to shape reality to some extent.  The haze will help you become exactly what you imagined yourself to be, or at least set you on the path.

# Engineer Chatham
This bloke will want some [Astral Diamonds](astral-diamond) in exchange for a one way ride out of this place.  Pretty useful if you find yourself back here for some reason, but you’ll miss out on some valuable lessons if you give in on your first journey.

So you’ve left those two odd ducks behind.  Bully for you.  So now what?  Well there’s an assortment of critters up ahead that would love to meet your fists.  Go ahead and single some unlucky individuals out and test out your prowess.  Go ahead, I’ll wait.

Feeling underwhelmed? Good.  This place will test your resolve, make you feel like you should rethink your life choices.  Don’t worry, you’ll be swimming in bodies in no time  if you just keep on keeping on.

[Rats](a-sneaking-ratman) and [Asrai](a-tortured-asrai) are good first targets and don’t take much softening up to knock down.  Asrai can be particularly rewarding as they’ll be “purified” upon defeat and heal you in thanks.  The rats can drop some herbs, [leather](leather)/cloth and occasionally a leather tunic that will all sell to merchants for a decent amount of change.

[Prowlers](an-icy-prowler) are a bit more difficult, but offer a lot more bang for your buck when it comes to experience.  Their [fangs](sharp-fang) are highly prized amongst [woodworkers](woodworking) as well for making implements of the stabbing variety.

Further in you’ll come across an assortment of strange individuals.  There’s a gnome, goes by the name [Avens](avens-reogia), trying to read in a library very obviously not built for gnomes.  He has been known to be a little gracious to those that help him with those hard to reach books, however.

[Melinda](melinda) is feeling a bit melancholic, but she’ll help you learn the basics of [crafting](tradeskills).  You’ll want to familiarize yourself with this as you’ll be spending a lot of time smashing things together in hopes of inventing the next big thing, whatever that  is.  There are other tortured souls out there that may be able to offer guidance in this field and probably some documents around here somewhere explaining some methods, but I’ll leave that up to you to tease out.

[Burl](burl) seems to be adjusting to his new life well enough, but is having some storage issues.  He’ll get you set up with a method to craft some backpacks, which you’ll be needing.

Your local merchant of forever and always in this little piece of eternity is [Serptious](septious-vendavious).  You may notice he’s rather, ah, afflicted.  Honestly, I wouldn’t trust him at all, but he’s the only game in town so if you’re wanting to find some coins to rub together, he’s your only option.  I’d suggest going on a bit of a killing spree in your general area and selling all of the shinies you collect so you can afford an assortment of backpacks and crafting containers.  A heavy smelter is mandatory, but the rest is optional but highly encouraged.

# Onward
So you’ve made some bags, got some crafting supplies, maybe you made yourself some leather armor and stabby daggers or a wooden sword of bludgeoning.  Now you’re itching for some real game.  Purgatory has just the opportunity for you! 

Shortly past your little encampment of friendly pals you’ll encounter some reptilian horses and ghostly finger-wagglers.  Now, you can be like ol’ Thrule here and jump a ghost thinking they’re all incorporeal and can’t cause no real harm, but see, the problem with these things is magic doesn’t need corporeal reality to mess you up, and mess you up they will.  Murder the familiars and avoid the ghosts until you’re leveled up a bit and can deal with them before they can turn you into a pile of cinders.   The familiars will drop a lot of [nectarnuts](nectarnut) which can be turned into [soup](nectarnut-soup) and [snacks](nectarnut-seeds) if you feel so culinarily inclined.  If you do happen to get revenge for ol’ Thrule here and send one of those ghosts to the great beyond then save up their precious [frozen chromium](frozen-chromium) as you’ll need it to make some armor later on.

Further in you may stumble across a morose ghost floating longingly by a table.  They may sometimes respond to a friendly acknowledgement in kind, or curse you.  Hard to say.  They’re a bit fickle.  I don’t like ghosts.

You’ll get to pick between foes of the arachnid or avian variety next up.  If you dabble in [alchemy](alchemy) you’ll probably spend a lot of time here collecting eyeballs for whatever it is you crazy alchemists do in your spare time.  Hey, I don’t judge.  You do you.  Folks eager to test their needle and thread skill will find an ample supply of feathers and silk threads which can be turned into an assortment of garments for personal use, most of which can be further augmented with a healthy splash of chromium.

While fighting spiders and wadding up [silk](spider-silk-strings) you may have noticed the occasional presence of a stern looking individual or two wandering into the room.  These [damned souls](a-damned-soul) can be a nuisance, but if dealt with can be great for training your skills and have been known to drop copper ore, which you’ll be needing a lot of.  Some of these blokes have held on to their worldly possessions before being deposited in Purgatory so you may be lucky enough to pry a blade or two from their hands, emphasis on may.

You’re kitted out in a suit of armor now, hopefully.  If not, you probably should be.  You’re going to need the extra protection now that you’re dealing with the upper echelons of the Purgatory hierarchy.  Your next foes are diminutive ice giants.  They must have a sweet tooth because I’ve found what I think is [ice cream](freeze-dried-sweet-cream) amongst their belongings in the past.  In hindsight, I could be terribly mistaken.  Best not to dwell on that thought.  You’ll probably avoid these passivists for the most part as they aren’t usually worth the trouble.  It’s basically damned souls all the way down, in all honesty.

You’ll find a side room with some emaciated second cousins of the ratmen you met earlier.  Don’t be misled by their lanky limbs, however, they pack quite a punch.  The [copper bits](copper-bits) they drop can give you an edge on making [ingots](copper-ingot) later if you can manage to knock them down before they do the same to you.  Careful you don’t get surrounded though, because even though they won’t help one another unless you get a little overzealous, they will come back and block off your escape rather quickly.

# Getting Into the Thick of Things

Eventually you’ll stumble upon my old friend [Dizian Maltor](dizian-maltor).  He’s a [Traveler](the-society-of-travelers), or so he’d fancy himself.  Pretty sure he means well, but I don’t have a good read on him in all honesty.  Either way, he’s got some grim tidings for you, or perhaps good news if you’re an optimist.  He’ll set you up with a lovely [spiritstone](spiritstone) for holding all the things that make you, you, and set you on the path to escape from here.  All you’ll need are a few trinkets and a bit of luck.

Beyond Dizian you’ll find two paths.  One will lead to a thing of nightmares that you probably won’t be able to tackle alone.  Give it a whirl though, who knows?  The other path will lead to a large room with glowing wisps of energy that will need to be beaten into submission to harvest.  Dizian referenced a power source and fuel, for it.  This is where you’ll find that fuel.  If you’re observant you’ll probably notice some strange floating objects in the area.  Probably should pocket one of those for later while you’re at it.

# Getting Out

The home stretch.  The music has probably drilled its way into your subconscious, changing the way you perceive reality or, more likely, driving you to find an escape route.  You’re almost there!  Remember that [smelter](heavy-smelter) I mentioned you’d need way back when?  If you listened you’ve been dragging that hunk of metal around for a while now, maybe refined some ore, and if you’re really lucky, an ingot or two.  Well if you have, you’re ahead of the game.  If you haven’t, well, the damned souls aren’t going anywhere, so go reacquaint yourself with them until you’ve managed to craft an ingot.

Dizian gave you a charging device and a [power source](drained-power-source).  Try throwing some of those bits of [energy](quasar-energy) you got from the wisps in the device with the power source to get that thing working again.  Dizian will have further instructions for you when you hand that in.

He’s kind of vague right?  Well, never you fear, Ol’ Thrule has all the answers on what to do next.  Remember those [floating things](limbo-stone) in the wisp room?  Yeah, that object I told you to pick up.  No?  Well you need to go back and get one of those if you didn’t listen.  Pull out that giant hunk of metal you call a smelter and try to combine a copper ingot with that strange item.  You’ll probably get a [hunk of ore](kraitoz-ingot) that’s definitely not named after an angsty God of War.

That’s not what Dizian wanted, and he’ll be sure to let you know that.  He’s too busy staring longingly down that hall to do any “real” work so break out your artisan gloves and throw that hunk of ore back into your smelter.  Think real hard about what you want it to be and maybe a miracle will happen.   Maybe not.  It is Purgatory after all.  If you made the [thing](kraitoz-gear) Dizian wanted he’ll gladly whisk you away to your new life.  If not, well, you know what to do.

I’ll see you in the [Nexus](nexus), refugee.  There’s so much to see.  Get to it.

Signed, Thrule Ursai
